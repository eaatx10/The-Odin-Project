# The Odin Project
This repo is contains all of the projects assigned from The Odin Project! The Odin Project is an open sourced full-stack developer course that aggregates different resources to help curious coders like myself learn mutliple langauages and frameworks. I am taking this course with the ultimate goal in mind to create my own personal website. I will outline my journey towards this goal in this readme.

The first official project after recreating the android logo was to design the Google homepage through html/css. You can find the link to the specific assignment and more information about it here:
